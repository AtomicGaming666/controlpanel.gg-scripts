This is a repository where I will be sharing all the scripts that I have made for Control Panel, free of charge. You are welcome to browse through these scripts, take the ones that you want, and even improve upon them if you wish.

## [Updater:](https://github.com/AtomicGaming666/controlpanel.gg-scripts/tree/main/updater)
This is a script that I created to update your Control Panel. It is intended to be used if you do not know how to update it yourself, or if you simply do not want to manually update it.
